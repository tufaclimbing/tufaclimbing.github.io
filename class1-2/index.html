        <h1>THE OAK AND THE ROSE</h1>

        <h2>by Shel Silverstein</h2>

        <p>
        <i>An oak tree and a rosebush grew,</br>
           Young and green together,</br>
           Talking the talk of growing things -</br>
           Wind and water and weather.</br>
           And while the rosebush sweetly bloomed</br>
           The oak tree grew so high</br>
           That now it spoke of newer things -</br>
           Eagles, mountain peaks and sky.</br>
           "I guess you think you're pretty great,"</br>
           The rose was heard to cry,</br>
           Screaming as loud as it possibly could</br>
           To the treetop in the sky.</br>
           "And now you have no time for flower talk,</br>
           Now that you've grown so tall"</br>
           "It's not so much that I've grown," said the tree,</br>
           "It's just that you've stayed so small."</i></br>
