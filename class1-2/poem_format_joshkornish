        <h1>THE OAK AND THE ROSE</h1>

        <h2>by Shel Silverstein</h2>

        <i>An oak tree and a rosebush grew,
           Young and green together,
           Talking the talk of growing things -
           Wind and water and weather.
           And while the rosebush sweetly bloomed
           The oak tree grew so high
           That now it spoke of newer things -
           Eagles, mountain peaks and sky.
           "I guess you think you're pretty great,"
           The rose was heard to cry,
           Screaming as loud as it possibly could
           To the treetop in the sky.
           "And now you have no time for flower talk,
           Now that you've grown so tall"
           "It's not so much that I've grown," said the tree,
           "It's just that you've stayed so small."</i>
