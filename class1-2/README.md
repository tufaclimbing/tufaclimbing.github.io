# Week 1.2 Poem Formatting assignment

Jumping straight into coding has been a tad bit overwhelming but practicing with the HTML tags has been super helpful.  To replicate the format of [The Oak and the Rose] (https://silverbirchpress.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-oak-and-the-rose-poem-by-shel-silverstein/) I referred to my markdown cheat sheet and supplemental Youtube tutorials.  I look forward to getting more comfortable with these programs to the point that I can work some creativity into my work.
